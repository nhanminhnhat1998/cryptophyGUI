Fun project

nessessary libary
```
sudo apt install python-pyqt5

my encryption code was base on this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSrrhP2vFS8&list=PL2Rx59pxrNEI2YSvx2og_vYGhXcHFASsT&index=2&t=0s

as well as update pyqt5 tutorial https://build-system.fman.io/pyqt5-tutorial, they have some really basic stuff
official site for more stuff: https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/index.html it is referenced in C++ but the same in python.
